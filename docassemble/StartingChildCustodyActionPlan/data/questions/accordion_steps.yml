template: paternity_step

  Step ${ paternity_idx }: Learn about paternity
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>General Paternity Information</div>
  <p>Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological  father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial  outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are. Once established, the father's name can be  placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial  responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's  biological father.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Establishing or disestablishing paternity in your custody case</div>
  <p>When you file your complaint, state that paternity is an issue in  section 3D of the complaint.  You can  prove or disprove paternity several ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Each  parent signs an affidavit stating the biological father.  Fill out:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Three-Way  Affidavit to Disestablish and Establish Paternity, SHC-151</strong> <a href="http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151.doc">Word</a> | <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-151n.pdf">PDF</a>,</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The  mother, child, and person who may be the father take a DNA test using a  painless swab inside the cheek. The whole process takes about 15 minutes and  the result is ready within about 3 weeks.  If someone is not cooperating or you want Child Support Services  Division to do the testing, fill out and attach these forms to your complaint:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Motion  &amp; Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1370 </strong><a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370.doc">Word</a> | <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1370n.pdf">PDF</a><strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Order for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-1375</strong> <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375.doc">Word</a> | <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1375n.pdf">PDF</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>You can  attach any DNA test results that have already been done to your complaint.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Change the Birth Certificate</div>
  <p>If the court decides that the biological father is someone not  listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the  Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate. After the birth certificate is changed, the  child is considered &quot;legitimated&quot; and the heir of that father. This  means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial  benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on  military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father  dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical  benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's  Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics  &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on  these benefits.</p>

  Step ${ parents_agree_idx }: Talk to the other parent to see if you agree
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>The Benefits of Reaching an Agreement</div>
  <p>If you and the other parent agree about the issues in the  case, you can avoid a trial.  Some  benefits are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working out the parenting plan instead of  fighting is better for the children</li>
    <li>You decide the outcome rather than a judge - you  know more about the issues in your case than the judge ever will</li>
    <li>Reaching an agreement may be more cooperative  than dealing with the issues in a trial, where each parent presents evidence  and makes arguments about what they want the judge to decide</li>
    <li>Reaching an agreement outside of court can save  time and money, and provide more privacy and confidentiality</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want help reaching an agreement before the case is  open, some options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk to the other parent about settling the case  without a trial.</li>
    <li>Mediation.</li>
    <li>Collaborative Law.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Talk to the other parent about settling the case without a trial</div>
  <p>Some parents want to work out the issues by agreement  without the judge deciding and are able to talk to each other in person,  on-line, or with the help of a friend or family member.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Mediation</div>
  <p>Mediation is an informal, voluntary, and confidential way  to resolve disagreements without giving the decision-making power to someone  else, like a judge. A neutral person, called the mediator, helps people outside  the court process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>figure out the important issues in the  disagreement</li>
    <li>explain and understand each other's needs</li>
    <li>clear up misunderstandings</li>
    <li>explore creative solutions</li>
    <li>reach acceptable agreements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Parents can hire their own private mediator to help  resolve any issue in the case.  If there  was abuse or domestic violence in your marriage, be sure to hire someone with  training and experience working with domestic violence, and tell your mediator  if you want to bring a trusted support person with you.<br>
    <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/mediation/index.htm">Read about mediation</a>.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Collaborative Law</div>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.alaskacollaborative.org/">Alaska  Association of Collaborative Professionals</a> helps people resolve parenting  issues outside of the court process without a judge making decisions. Learn more about the group.<br>
    Watch a video<br>
    Watch a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EuW9HET3nM&list=PLRS0LlEIQsuTsfO0wSTsSTIvVE5RO8sLc&index=6&t=3s">video  that discusses resolving your case</a> by reaching agreement with the other  parent.  It discusses mediation and  settlement conferences which may be available to you using free court programs  once you file your case.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Talk to a Lawyer</div>
  <p>It is a good idea to get legal advice by talking to an  attorney about an agreement. Both parents need to understand how agreeing to  each issue affects the other issues in the agreement. If you agree to something  without thinking it through, there can be serious and long-standing  consequences. Once a judge signs off on your agreement, it will be a binding  court order that outlines each parents' responsibilities and rights regarding  the issues in the case.</p>

  Step ${ jurisdiction_idx }: Check if Alaska has jurisdiction
content: |
  <ul>
    <li>A court must have the authority called  jurisdiction to issue an order about a custody or parenting plan or a child  support order.</li>
    <li>Generally, only the court in the state where the  child has lived for the last 6 months can make decisions, enter a parenting  plan, or order child support. This is  called the child's &quot;home state.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between  states, there may not be a "home state."  This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to  decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.  <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm">Talking to a lawyer</a> can  help you decide which is the best state for your case.</p>

  <p><strong>People who have  experienced domestic violence can be at greater risk when they start a court  case.</strong> During this time, safety is very important. The dynamics in a relationship with domestic  violence may also cause people to feel pressured to agree to something they  don't want. If this is your situation,  these resources may help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find a <a href="https://www.andvsa.org/communitys-programs">domestic violence program</a> in your area to learn about what services they offer (counseling, financial  assistance, housing and safe shelter, resources for children, and help with  court).</li>
    <li>Ask the  court for a protective order.  You can  get information about asking for a protective order by answering more  questions.  If you want to save this  Action Plan, be sure to download, save, or print it. then return to the Guided Assist page and use  the Guided Assist search box to find &quot;Protective Orders.&quot;</li>
    <li>See if  you qualify for the <a href="https://www.andvsa.org/for-survivors/">legal  assistance through your local domestic violence program</a> or <a href="https://www.alsc-law.org/apply-for-services">Alaska Legal Services</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  % if which_forms in('agree','both'): 
    However, some parents in a relationship that includes domestic  violence are comfortable reaching an agreement about a parenting plan for a  variety of reasons.  Sometimes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the  domestic violence does not make either parent uncomfortable or afraid to ask  for what they want in the parenting plan;</li>
    <li>if the  domestic violence does make a parent uncomfortable or afraid, provisions are  used to make the process of trying to reach an agreement feel safer (having a  support person present, having a mediator or a trusted third person help with  discussions, not meeting in-person, meeting in different rooms, or talking  about an agreement through email, text or telephone);</li>
    <li>one  parent's main goal is to finish the case and be done in a safe manner so they  are willing to give up some things in the agreement that they may be entitled  to under the law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can decide whether you are comfortable trying to reach an  agreement with the other parent based on the facts and circumstances of your  case.  As explained below, if you want to  try to reach an agreement about the parenting plan, your options may be limited  if there has been domestic violence.</p>

  <div class='step-subheading'>How domestic violence affects custody</div>

  <ul>
    <li>The law presumes that a parent with a  &quot;history of domestic violence&quot; not get custody or unsupervised  visitation unless he or she meets certain requirements. These may include  completing a batterer's intervention or substance abuse treatment program.</li>
    <li>A &quot;history of domestic violence&quot; is  defined by the law as either one incident of domestic violence that caused  serious physical injury, or more than one incident.  The parent's domestic violence behavior needs  to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law.  There does not have to be a protective order  or criminal case for the court to find a parent has a history of domestic  violence.  The court can find domestic  violence based on one parent's testimony.</li>

  % else:
  <div class='step-subheading'>Contact between parent &amp; children</div>
  % endif
    <p>If you think the other parent should not have any contact with  your children, you will need to convince the judge that it is in the children's  best interest. Generally, it is unusual  for a judge in a divorce or custody case to decide that a parent cannot see his  or her children. There is research that shows it is important for children to  have a relationship with both parents if it can happen in a safe manner. If the judge finds the domestic violence  presumption applies, the judge will usually permit supervised contact between  the parent and the children while the parent is completing a batterer's  intervention or substance abuse treatment program. After the parent finishes the program and any  other requirements the judge ordered, the judge may lift the supervision  restriction and allow a different parenting schedule.</p>
  % if which_forms == 'contested': 
  <div class='step-subheading'>Tell the judge your concerns</div>
  % endif
    <p>The judge will only know about your domestic violence concerns if  you state them in the documents you file and when you talk in court. If you have concerns for the children's  safety when in the care of the other parent, or for yourself when interacting  with the other parent, describe them to the judge. If the judge is going to allow the other  parent to have parenting time (visitation) with the children, you can suggest  ways to address your concerns. Some  options include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>no drugs  or alcohol prior to or during the visits,</li>
    <li>drug or  alcohol testing and/or treatment,</li>
    <li>no  overnight visitation,</li>
    <li>no  excessive discipline or spanking,</li>
    <li>no  emotional abuse such as cursing at or name calling,</li>
    <li>no saying  anything bad about you to or in front the children or letting anyone else do  it,</li>
    <li>no  inappropriate exposure to adult activities such as pornography,</li>
    <li>exchanges  only at public or specified places,</li>
    <li>supervised  exchanges by a willing and available third party who you trust,</li>
    <li>parenting  time only occur in a public or specified place,</li>
    <li>supervised  parenting time with a willing and available third party who you trust, or</li>
    <li>no contact  between the children and specific individuals you are concerned about.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you think you or your children's health, safety, or liberty  would be harmed by providing the information on the <strong>Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit</strong>, <a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-150.pdf">DR-150</a> to  the other parent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not  give the other parent a copy of the completed <strong>Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit</strong> after you file it with the  court, and</li>
    <li>File <strong>Direction  to Seal Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit</strong>, <a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-151.pdf">DR-151</a>.</li>
