under: |
  #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
  You are required to give the other parent a copy of everything you file in court to start the case so the other parent can participate.  You may have to work hard to find the other parent.  If you cannot find the other parent, there is a special court process to follow.
---
id: Paternity
question: |
  Paternity
subquestion: |
  Sometimes paternity is an issue in a custody case.  Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological father of a child. Once established, the father's name can be placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial responsibility for the child. Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's biological father.  Do you want your Action Plan to include information about paternity?
yesno: paternity
---
id: Default
question: |
  Default
subquestion: |
  To start your case, you need to file a complaint with the court and send copies to the other parent.
  
  The other parent has 20 days to file a written response. Their response is their Answer.
   
  If the other parent does not file an Answer in 20 days, you can ask the judge for a “default judgment.”  
  
  If you get a default judgment, the case can move forward. The other parent does not need to be there and the judge may order the custody arrangement you asked for.  
  
  
  Do you want your Action Plan to include information about Filing for Default if the other parent does not file an their Answer within 20 days?
yesno: default
---
id: Do you and the other parent agree
question: |
  Do you and the other parent agree?

  * a Parenting Plan that includes: 
      * a plan for making decisions,
      * a schedule,
   * paternity, and
   * child support.
   
   You can start the case on your own if you do not agree.  
   
   Which forms do you want to use?
field: which_forms
choices:
  - "Forms for if we both agree": agree
  - "Forms to start the case on my own": contested
  - "I don’t know if we agree on everything, but I would like information about talking to the other parent to see if we agree." : both

id: Domestic violence
question: |
  If there is abuse or domestic violence between you and the other parent it may affect your case and the parenting plan
subquestion: |
  Do you want your Action Plan to include information about how domestic violence affects your case?
yesno: domestic_violence
under: |
  #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
  % if which_forms == 'agree':
  Sometimes a person in a relationship with domestic violence feels pressured to agree to things they do not want.  The law presumes that a parent with a "history of domestic violence" may not get custody and unsupervised visitation without completing some court-approved treatment.  The parent’s domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law.  A "history of domestic violence" is defined as one incident that caused serious physical injury, or more than one incident.  The court can find domestic violence based on one parent’s testimony even if there was no protective order or criminal case.
